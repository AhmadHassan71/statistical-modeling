# Statistical Modeling Using PyMC3

This repository contains code and resources for performing statistical modeling using PyMC3, a powerful Python library for Bayesian modeling and probabilistic programming. Whether you're new to Bayesian statistics or an experienced practitioner, this repository aims to provide you with a foundation for conducting Bayesian data analysis using PyMC3.


## Introduction

Bayesian statistics is a powerful approach to modeling and inference that allows us to quantify uncertainty and make data-driven decisions. PyMC3 is a popular library that simplifies the process of building and estimating Bayesian models. In this repository, we provide resources, tutorials, and examples to help you get started with Bayesian modeling using PyMC3.

## Installation

To get started with the code and examples in this repository, you'll need to install PyMC3 and other required dependencies. Here are the steps to set up your environment:
